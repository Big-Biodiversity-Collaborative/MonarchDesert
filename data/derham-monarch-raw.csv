1976,11,11,"Dodd Spring Trail, HunterCanyon Mtn, North End of Salin Valley",3,,,,Derham Giuliani,,,,1,,,In a canyon was large milkweed with dead monarch larvae from freeze. Saw 3 monarchs.
1976,11,13,HunterCanyon,Occasional,,,,Derham Giuliani,,,,1,Poplar,,Saw occasional monarch drifting about. Saw one monarch resting inactive with wings down in poplar. Wings of at least 2 dead ones under tree
1976,12,15,McElvoyCanyon,400,212,,,Derham Giuliani,1600,,,2,Larrea,7 degrees C,"Harold Wood Jr. and I drove up to the mouth of McElvoyCanyon Canyon, E side Inyo Mts. Near the mouth, in the canyon on the north side, were several Monarch butterflies drifting back & forth. On Larrea, near the stream, were occasional clumps of Monarchs in their characteristic sleeping or hibernating positions. I took 2 or 3 photos of them. The sun was warming them and many took off at my movements, often returning to resettle in the same clump.
-The water was flowing beyond the mouth for an indeterminate distance. As the mouth of the canyon was 
approached the Monarchs were no longer present, except for an occasional single individual in deep shade too cold to respond. All Monarchs seen were on Larrea, none on Mesquite. Inside the mouth 3 separate individuals were found on the ground far from each other--only the 4 wings and no body.
-From 300 to 500 feet below the canyon mouth there were 6 Monarch swarms on Larrea bushes. Each was 5 to 8 feet above the ground & consisted of closely-packed butterflies looking like dead leaves hanging on the branches. They were all at the ends of live branches, not down in the shrubs. All were on the north side of the stream and between 10 and 20 feet from the stream. None were in flight, it was about 4PM and the area had been in shade for some time; air temp in a butterfly clump was 7DegC and the water temp = 10DegC. They did not react to any motion beside them except for a few that opened & closed their wings. There were 6 butterfly clumps; the largest contained at least 212 individuals, the 2nd largest had a count of 53, the rest had 20 to 30 each--a total of close to 400. I walked on down the creek for at least 500 more feet but saw not a single individual. There seems to be none in the valley, and none in the dark narrow canyons--I wonder how many are near the mouths of other canyons, or higher up where canyons open up more.
-I could not find any dead ones on the ground under the butterfly clumps, indicating that they are surviving temperatures well below freezing. However, a rain followed by cold will be a different matter; so far this year the combination of wet & cold has not yet occurred. Normally that happens by November which, at Big Pine, always kills off the year's Pygmy Blue population--this year the Blues are still flying by mid December."
